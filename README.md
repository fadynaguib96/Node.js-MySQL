# Node.js-MySQL

<h3> In this application, an amazon-like storefront was created with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. </h3>

<h4> The node app communicates with the MySQL database and displays results of user input based on the information initially set up by administrator. The user gets a shopping list and chooses items by ID. The app returns message based on the inventory information from the database while the mySql database gets updated based on the user's order. </h4>
